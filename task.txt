REST - JSON

1. GET /users -> it will list all the users.

2. GET /users/id -> get the users with id. 

3. POST /users -> it will create a new user.

4. PATCH /users/id -> it will edit the user according to the user id.

5. DELETE /users/id -> delete that particular user with that id.

The data will me hardcoded in MOCK_DATA.json.

we will build a hybrid server in which if a user go to the '/' route it will render a html docummets 
    and if the user request on '/api/users' then, it will return a json api restfull data.
